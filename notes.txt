Ways to be smarter about this:
  when should we re-scrape?
  scrape submission urls until we find one we already know, then stop
  occasionally scrape for new galleries

  documents:
    user: accounts
    thing:  user here (or not -- users know what's under em), user there (account?), source network, 
            thumb url, source url, title, something age-related to sort by


  todo:
    cache the thumbnails myself with s3
    
    
  ideas: (optional)
    show linked pages in an iframe with next/prev links, ratings, faves
    javascript page-mangling to make linked pages look better
